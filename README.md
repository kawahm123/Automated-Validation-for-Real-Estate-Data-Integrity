# Automated Validation for Real Estate Data Integrity
<h2>Description</h2>
This Python script processes a CSV file containing real estate data by executing multiple data validations to identify issues such as outliers, mismatches, null values, and duplicates. It reads the data into a pandas DataFrame, applies the validations based on placeholder criteria, and identifies listings that meet these criteria or are duplicate entries. The results are categorized into separate DataFrames corresponding to each validation type. These results are then compiled into an Excel file, with each validation type on a separate sheet and an added "Table of Contents" sheet for easy navigation. The Excel file is saved in a specified output directory with a name that includes the current date, ensuring data integrity and facilitating efficient issue tracking.
